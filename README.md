# Raspberry-pi-servo-movement-trakcer
A Raspberry pi and arduino that control a servo to always look at movement, the servo itself moves but the camera is fixed on something else,
if you are looking for a servo that has a camera mounted to it that will track faces I would look elsewhere. I apologize in advance  for confusion.

Also I have not included the opencv module because it was too large to upload so here is the link to download directly and not have to go through some
crazy guide bs: https://github.com/opencv/opencv, download the zip file and unpack
